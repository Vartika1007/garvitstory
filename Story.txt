 Every day, he set out into the nearby forest to cut trees.

  He earned just about enough to make a living, but he was satisfied with his simple living.

  One day, while cutting a tree near a river, his axe slipped out of his hand and fell into the river. 
   The river was so deep, he could not even think to retrieve it on his own. He only had one axe which was gone into the river.
